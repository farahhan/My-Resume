    <h2 >Industrial Internship</h2>
     <h3 >&#127893; Pejabat Daerah Mersing</h3>

<div class="content-row">
    <img src="intern.jpg" class="exp-img" >
<p> During the previous semester break, an internship was completed at Pejabat
Daerah Mersing where various administrative and organizational tasks were handled.
The responsibilities included managing minute records, organising filing systems,
designing boat safety posters, and creating a Merdeka banner that was used during
the district-level Hari Kemerdekaan celebration. The role also involved keying in
staff thumbprint attendance using Excel and ensuring that all records were updated
and properly maintained throughout the internship.
The experience further included assisting in meeting arrangements by preparing
attendance lists, managing presentation slides, and ensuring the required names 
and documents were ready before each session. Although the internship period was
short, it provided meaningful exposure to government office operations and offered
practical knowledge in documentation, coordination, and event preparation. The
experience was valuable and contributed to a stronger understanding of
administrative procedures and workplace responsibilities. </p>

   <p>As part of an entrepreneurship subject, this project was a fun and hands-on 
experience that strengthened both teamwork and basic business skills. Collaborated 
with a team of five to manage sourbelt sales through WhatsApp and Telegram 
advertising groups. Responsibilities included packing products, coordinating
COD arrangements, and handling customer inquiries. I also assisted with simple
stock management to ensure sufficient supply for daily orders. This project was

fulfil orders smoothly and deliver products on time.</p>

    <h2>Participation and Support in Public Events </h2>
     
     <h3>&#127893;Xtif Johor Fun Run</h3>
  <div class="content-row">
    <p> Served as part of the event secretariat for the Xtif Johor Fun Run, 
supporting programme coordination, participant flow, and on-ground 
arrangements. Responsibilities included assisting the organizing team,
guiding participants, and ensuring smooth event execution. The 
programme began with Subuh prayer at Pantai Air Papan, followed by a
3.5 km run at around 7 a.m. alongside the Chief Minister of Johor, leading
participants along the scenic route towards Pantai Air Papan before 
concluding with official proceedings and the prize-giving ceremony for
the top 10 finishers.</p>

     <h3>&#127893;National Day parade</h3>

   <div class="content-row">
      <img src="intern1.jpg" class="exp-img">
    <p> Participated for the first time as part of the district-level National Day 
parade, representing Pejabat Daerah Mersing. Responsibilities included 
carrying the district office banner and following the parade formation
to ensure smooth coordination. The rehearsal session was conducted to
ensure the celebration ran seamlessly. On the main day, the parade
commenced with formal opening activities, followed by a procession 
where I carried the banner along the parade route, witnessing performances
such as poetry recitals, military skits, and cultural presentations.
The event concluded with official ceremonies, making it a memorable 
and enriching experience.</p>

      <h2>CSR</h2>

    <h3 >&#127893;Beach Cleaning Program</h3>

     <div class="content-row">
    <p> Participated in a community beach cleaning initiative at Tanjung Resang,
organized as part of a CSR programme by UKM. Previously, the Tanjung
Resang beach area had been neglected and filled with scattered waste,
making the program especially meaningful. Activities included 
collecting rubbish, organizing designated cleanup zones, and promoting
environmental awareness. Separately, I also joined a beach cleaning
activity at Pulau Hujung on another day, further contributing to
maintaining a clean and sustainable coastal environment. This involvement
helped restore the beauty of both locations while fostering a stronger
sense of community responsibility.</p>
