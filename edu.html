<p style="text-align:justify;"> I continued my studies in an Islamic secondary school environment.Throughout
these years, I was surrounded by supportive teachers and friends who 
guided me, especially in core subjects like Arabic and Mathematics, which
were my favourite subjects in high school. I am truly grateful to have
been surrounded by such kind and helpful people.<br>
I carry countless memories from those days, moments that will never happen
twice and can only be experienced during school life. I also met many people 
along the way, and each of them gave me meaningful experiences. It was there 
that I learned the true meaning of discipline, friendship, and growing up. 
Words can’t describe how much I miss my high school days. </p></td>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Entering diploma marked a new chapter
in my academic journey. I learned many new things that I had never
experienced before, and I also made a lot of new friends along the way.
I gained countless experiences and met people with all kinds of 
personalities. I’m truly grateful to my friends who worked together
through countless assignments, supporting each other until we successfully
completed our diploma with excellence. I am also happy and grateful to
have had such kind and supportive lecturers who always guided us and 
helped us improve our assignments. I truly enjoyed my diploma years, 
especially with friends who made every moment meaningful and fun.
